# Clustering_Test_NLP
Spooky Author Identification; Testing k-means algorithms against other ML classification algorithms.


# Introduction
The aim of this paper is to build models that can identify the author of small unknown text (sentence) after converting it to a set of variables (ex. number of words, number of letters, etc…). Some classical algorithms are used like K-NN, Naïve Bayes, and K-means, and their results are compared to results obtained using more advanced methods (machine learning models) like Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
> Note
> All methods except K-means are in [NLP.R](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Clustering_Test_NLP/blob/main/NLP.R) file.
> 
> K-means algorithm is built from scratch for educational purposes in [clustering.py](https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEnan/Clustering_Test_NLP/blob/main/clustering.py)

The goal was accomplished by data pre-processing and generating new features, followed by training models on dataset, then testing models performance, and finally model improving using different techniques.
